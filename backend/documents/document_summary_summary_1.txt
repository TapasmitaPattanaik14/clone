This document outlines a monthly progress review for the Gen-AI team.  The team has made significant progress in developing production-ready AI solutions, focusing primarily on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation and Large Language Model (LLM) integration.  Key technical achievements include building a multi-document RAG chatbot capable of handling multiple file formats and exhibiting advanced context handling.  The team utilized Python, PostgreSQL, LangChain, LLaMA Index, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini technologies, along with React and Angular for the frontend.  They also made considerable advancements in optimizing vector embeddings and context window management for faster and more accurate query responses.  A KlariFAI clone project is underway, with the requirements analysis complete and core functionality implementation in progress.  Challenges encountered, such as large document handling and context relevance, were successfully addressed.  Future plans involve mastering cloud platforms (Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, GCP Vertex AI), enhancing MLOps capabilities, and implementing robust CI/CD pipelines.  The presenter expressed satisfaction with the team's technical growth but identified areas for improvement in project delivery.
